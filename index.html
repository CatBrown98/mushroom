		<p><h2>An Introduction to Mushrooms</h2></p>
		<p>A <strong>mushroom</strong> or <strong>toadstool</strong> is the fleshy, spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus, typically produced above ground, on soil, or on its food source.</p>
		
		<p>The standard for the name "mushroom" is the cultivated white button mushroom, <i class="latin">Agaricus bisporus</i>; hence the word "mushroom" is most often applied to those fungi (<i class="latin">Basidiomycota, Agaricomycetes</i>) that have a stem (<i class="latin">stipe</i>), a cap (<i class="latin">pileus</i>), and gills (<i class="latin">lamella</i>) on the underside of the cap. "Mushroom" also describes a variety of other gilled fungi, with or without stems, therefore the term is used to describe the fleshy fruiting bodies of some <i class="latin">Ascomycota</i>. These gills produce microscopic spores that help the fungus spread across the ground or its occupant surface.</p>
		
		<p>Forms deviating from the standard morphology usually have more specific names, such as <i>"bolete"</i>, <i>"puffball"</i>, <i>"stinkhorn"</i>, and <i>"morel"</i>, and gilled mushrooms themselves are often called <i class="latin">"agarics"</i> in reference to their similarity to <i class="latin">Agaricus</i> or their order <i class="latin">Agaricales</i>. By extension, the term <i>"mushroom"</i> can also refer to either the entire fungus when in culture, the thallus (called a <i>mycelium</i>) of species forming the fruiting bodies called mushrooms, or the species itself.</p>

		<p><h2>Etymology</h2></p>
		<p>The terms "mushroom" and "toadstool" go back centuries and were never precisely defined, nor was there consensus on application. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the terms <i>mushrom</i>, <i>mushrum</i>, <i>muscheron</i>, <i>mousheroms</i>, <i>mussheron</i>, or <i>musserouns</i> were used.</p>
		
		<p>The term "mushroom" and its variations may have been derived from the French word <i class="french">mousseron</i> in reference to moss (<i class="french">mousse</i>). Delineation between edible and poisonous fungi is not clear-cut, so a "mushroom" may be edible, poisonous, or unpalatable.</p>
			
			<p>Cultural or social phobias of mushrooms and fungi may be related. The term <dfn id="def-fungophobia">"fungophobia"</dfn> was coined by William Delisle Hay of England, who noted a national superstition or fear of "toadstools".</p>
			
			<p>The word "toadstool" has apparent analogies in Dutch <i class="dutch">padde(n)stoel</i> (toad-stool/chair, mushroom) and German <i class="german">Krötenschwamm</i> (toad-fungus, alt. word for <i>panther cap</i>). In German folklore and old fairy tales, toads are often depicted sitting on toadstool mushrooms and catching, with their tongues, the flies that are said to be drawn to the <i class="german">Fliegenpilz</i>, a German name for the toadstool, meaning "flies' mushroom". This is how the mushroom got another of its names, <i class="german">Krötenstuhl</i> (a less-used German name for the mushroom), literally translating to "toad-stool".</p>
